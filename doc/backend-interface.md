A client can be nuqql or a user connecting via, e.g., telnet to a backend. The
client sends commands to the backend and the backend sends replies back to the
client. In the following sections, all commands, replies, and their
descriptions are listed:

`<user>`, and status `<status>`.

## Message Receiving and Sending

### Receiving Messages from other Users

There is no command to receive new messages from other users. The backend
forwards new messages automatically to the connected backend client. See reply
below for the message format.


#### Reply

```
message: <acc_id> <destination> <timestamp> <sender> <msg>
```

For each message received from another user, the backend sends a `message`
message to the backend client that contains the account id `<acc_id>`, the
recipient of the message `<destination>`, a time stamp `<timestamp>`, the user
name of the sender `<sender>`, and the message itself `<msg>`.

Special characters in `<msg>` like newlines, quotes, less than, or greater than
characters are escaped like in html documents.


#### Examples

Note: the newlines in the following examples are just to keep the displayed
line length below 80 and would not appear in real messages.
