# nuqql

nuqql is a Command line instant messenger inspired by [centericq](http://thekonst.net/centericq/) and [centerim](http://www.centerim.org) written in Python and using ncurses.

Currently, nuqql requires [purpled](https://github.com/hwipl/purpled) as a backend. purpled is a daemon that uses libpurple and allows nuqql to connect to multiple chat networks.
